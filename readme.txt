Stripped of most UI stuff.*

To script does as follows:
1. take selection in project window.
2. make a target folder (with prompt)
3. make a comp of every item in selection with 12 fps, 1 frame long, in the footage size
4. apply a effect preset**

todo: an external xml or json file or txt to read in the variables.
todo: an add to renderque would be nice

* Thanx to the great documentation and the straight structure within the code
** The applied Preset has to be in the same folder as the script and the name has to be XXX
