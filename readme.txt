compify2_slim.jsx based on compify2.jsx by XXX moded by fabiantheblind
fit a workflow. Stripped of most UI stuff.
To script does as follows:
1. take selection in project window.
2. make a target folder (with prompt)
3. make a comp of everyitem with 12 fps 1 frame long in the footage size
4. apply a effect preset
The applied Preset has to be in the same folder as the script and the name has to be XXX

todo: an external xml or json file or txt to read in the variables.
todo: an add to renderque would be nice
